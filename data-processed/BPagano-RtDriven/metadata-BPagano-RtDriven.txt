methods_long: "On our website we present daily projections for\
  \ infections and deaths for 108 countries, 52 US states/territories,\ 
  \ and 63 US counties.\
  \ For the US we calculate mortality rates by US region and time\
  \ based on the ages of people infected in a given region.\
  \ We provide the following data as a function of time and place:\
  \ cumulative and daily confirmed cases, cumulative and daily deaths,\
  \ confirmed case-based and death-based effective transmission ratios,\
  \ fraction of populations infected and constant infections transmission ratio,\
  \ probability of Covid-19 contact,\
  \ mortality and undercount, and fraction of positive tests.\
  \ Our projections are driven by the effective transmission ratio, Rt.\
  \ More specifically we run an SIR model using deaths and another using cases\
  \ resulting in Rt for deaths and Rt for cases. We use the average of these\
  \ two as the starting point or driver for our projections (new: 20-10-18).\
  \ For forecast how Rt will change with time, we analyze Rt change data through\
  \ the course of the pandemic and apply a model of that characteristic behavior\
  \ to forecast infections and deaths.\
  \ UPDATE 20-10-18: Changed Rt forecast from Rt for deaths to the average of\
  \ Rt for deaths and Rt for cases.\
  \ UPDATE 20-10-25: Changed from Sunday forecast to the average of\
  \ Friday, Saturday and Sunday forecasts.\
  \ UPDATE 20-11-08: Corrected undercount calculation approach\
  \ resulting in an increase in forecasted cases."
