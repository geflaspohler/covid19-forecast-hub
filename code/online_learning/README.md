# Online Learning
This directory contains code necessary to run several adaptive, online learning algorithms to ensemble Covid forecasts in a no-regret fashion.

Before running the code, ensure that you've updated the forecast data files from the master branch of the parent fork of the covidhub repo:
```
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```
